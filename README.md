# Simple-OpenCV-Sketcher
A simple OpenCV Sketcher for Portraits and gif making
Hi there! This is a simple notebook for Potrait Sketching and Gif Making 
I have used the Pop Art from Andrew Jones' rendition on how to make pop art linked below
https://www.analytics-link.com/post/2019/07/11/creating-pop-art-using-opencv-and-python
and for the pointilism art, i have used a very neat library designed by tsennott also linked below
https://pypi.org/project/pointillism/
This was just a pastime project as to how to sketch images and potraits for anything and anyone 
if you like it you can star it and fork it and if any help is needed,  I would love to help as well

Oh Word of Advice, you will see in the notebook that i have done the pop art before i have passed 
the Ipython Interactivity Shell prompt. If you pass the prompt before you do the pop art, It will show
you the calculation of each pixel and numpy array multiplication which will cause crashes if you are using 
limited RAM and it takes a long time, So please take care while using and thanks again if you do check it out!
